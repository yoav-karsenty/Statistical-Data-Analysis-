# Statistical-Data-Analysis-
In this project, i will investigate data for the telecom operator Megaline
. I am going to carry out a preliminary analysis of the plans based on a relatively small client selection. I have the data on 500 Megaline clients: who the clients are, where they're from, which plan they use, and the number of calls they made and text messages they sent in 2018. 
In the project, I will analyze clients' behavior and determine which prepaid plan brings in more revenue.

# Skills demonstrated :
